You are given a code contest problem:

problem name: '1575_A. Another Sorting Problem'


problem description:
=====
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

    2. Comparing the first character of each title in ascending order, we find that "AZ" is the smallest title because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position.

    3. Next, we compare the second character of each title in descending order. Among the remaining titles, "AB" is the smallest because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'B' comes before 'A' in the second position.

    4. Continuing this process, we find that the next smallest title is "AA" because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'A' comes before 'B' in the second position.

    5. The next smallest title is "BB" because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'B' comes before 'A' in the second position.

    6. Finally, the last title is "BA" because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'A' comes before 'B' in the second position.

    Therefore, the output is "5 2 1 3 4".

Your goal is to come up with possible solutions to the code contest problem.

Guidelines:
- Make sure each solution fully addresses the problem goals, constraints, examples, and notes.
- Each solution must have reasonable runtime and memory complexity - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large inputs.
- Double-check the solutions. Each possible solution must be able to generalize to additional test cases, not just the ones provided in the problem description.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $ProblemSolutions, according to the following Pydantic definitions:

    One possible solution is to implement a custom sorting algorithm that compares the strings based on the specified order. Here's how the solution works:

    1. Read the input values for n and m.

    2. Read the n book titles and store them in a list.

    3. Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings based on the specified order. The function should compare the odd-indexed characters in ascending order and the even-indexed characters in descending order.

    4. Sort the list of book titles using the custom comparison function.

    5. Output the indices of the sorted book titles.

  why_it_works: |
    This solution correctly solves the problem by implementing a custom sorting algorithm that compares the strings based on the specified order. The custom comparison function ensures that the odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order and the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order. By sorting the list of book titles using this custom comparison function, we can obtain the desired sorting order.

  why_it_works: |
    This solution correctly solves the problem by using an index mapping approach. Instead of directly sorting the book titles, we sort a list of indices based on the specified order.

By sorting the list of indices using this custom comparison function, we can obtain the desired sorting order.

    This solution correctly solves the problem by using an index mapping approach. Instead of directly sorting the book titles, we sort a list of indices based on the specified order. The custom comparison function ensures that the odd-indexed characters of the corresponding book titles are compared in ascending order and the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order. By sorting the list of indices using this custom comparison function, we can obtain the desired sorting order.

  labels:
  - sorting
  - index mapping
  complexity: |
    The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m * log(n)), where n is the number of book titles and m is the length of each title. This is because the sorting algorithm takes O(n * m * log(n)) time to sort the list of indices. The space complexity is O(n) to store the list of indices.

    Another possible solution is to use a radix sort algorithm. Here's how the solution works:

    1. Read the input values for n and m.

    2. Read the n book titles and store them in a list.

    3. Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings based on the specified order. The function should compare the odd-indexed characters in ascending order and the even-indexed characters in descending order.

    4. Perform a radix sort on the list of book titles using the custom comparison function as the key.

    5. Output the indices of the sorted book titles.

You are given a code contest problem and a self-reflection on the problem:


problem description:
======
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Example

Input


5 2
AA
AB
BB
BA
AZ


Output


5 2 1 3 4

Note

The following illustrates the first example.

self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

Here are also explanations for the problem test cases:
============
- input: |
    5 2
    AA
    AB
    BB
    BA
    AZ
  output: |
    5 2 1 3 4
  explanation: |
    In this example, we have 5 book titles with 2 characters each.
    The first character of each title is compared in ascending order, while the second character is compared in descending order.

    Let's go through the sorting process step by step:

    1. Initially, the titles are in the following order: "AA", "AB", "BB", "BA", "AZ".

    2. Comparing the first character of each title in ascending order, we find that "AZ" is the smallest title because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position.

    3. Next, we compare the second character of each title in descending order. Among the remaining titles, "AB" is the smallest because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'B' comes before 'A' in the second position.

    4. Continuing this process, we find that the next smallest title is "AA" because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'A' comes before 'B' in the second position.

    5. The next smallest title is "BB" because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'B' comes before 'A' in the second position.

    6. Finally, the last title is "BA" because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, and 'A' comes before 'B' in the second position.

    Therefore, the output is "5 2 1 3 4".

  explanation: |
    In this example, we have 1000 book titles with 1000 characters each. The first character of each title is compared in ascending order. Since 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, the output starts with the index of the title "ZZZZZZZZZZ...". Next, we compare the second character of each title in descending order. Among the remaining titles, "YYYYYYYYYY..." is the smallest because 'A' comes before 'B' in the first position, 'B' comes before 'C' in the second position, and so on. Continuing this process, we find that the next smallest title is "XXXXXXXXXX..." and so on, until we reach the last title "AAAAAAAAAA...".

You are given a code contest problem and a self-reflection on the problem:


problem description:
======
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Example

Input


5 2
AA
AB
BB
BA
AZ


Output


5 2 1 3 4

Note

The following illustrates the first example.

self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

Your goal is to consider each AI-generated test, and make sure the output and the explanation are correct. Be critical - they could be wrong.

Guidelines:
- Read the problem description carefully. Make sure the output and the explanations are consistent with them, and between themselves.
- The test explanations must coherently and logically lead from the input to the output.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $ProblemTests, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
Class Test(BaseModel):
    input: str
    output: str
    explanation: str = Field(description="Explanation of how the input leads to the output.")
    what_was_wrong: Optional[str] = Field(description="Describe shortly what was wrong with the previous output or the explanation, and how you fixed it. Leave empty if nothing was wrong.")

class ProblemTests(BaseModel):
    tests: List[Test] = Field(min_items=8, max_items=8)

You are given a code contest problem, and a self-reflection on the problem.


problem description:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Example

Input


5 2
AA
AB
BB
BA
AZ


Output


5 2 1 3 4

Note

The following illustrates the first example.

=============


self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

Your goal is to generate a valid Python code that correctly solves the code contest problem, using the following algorithm:
=============
name: Sorting and Comparing
content: |
  One possible solution is to implement a custom sorting algorithm that compares the strings based on the specified order. Here's how the solution works:

  1. Read the input values for n and m.

  2. Read the n book titles and store them in a list.

  3. Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings based on the specified order. The function should compare the odd-indexed characters in ascending order and the even-indexed characters in descending order.

  4. Sort the list of book titles using the custom comparison function.

  5. Output the indices of the sorted book titles.

why: |
  This solution correctly solves the problem by implementing a custom sorting algorithm that compares the strings based on the specified order. The custom comparison function ensures that the odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order and the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order. By sorting the list of book titles using this custom comparison function, we can obtain the desired sorting order.

flow:
- Read the input values for n and m.
- Read the n book titles and store them in a list.
- Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings based on the specified order.
- Sort the list of book titles using the custom comparison function.
- Output the indices of the sorted book titles.

Guidelines:
- You must divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Variables names should also be meaningful.
- Double-check the solution code. The generated solution must generalize to any valid input, and not just the provided examples.
- Make sure to include all the necessary module imports, properly initialize the variables, and address the problem constraints.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.



The code output must follow this structure:
```
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

problem description:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

Your goal is to generate a valid Python code that correctly solves the code contest problem, using the following algorithm:
=============
name: Sorting and Comparing
content: |
  One possible solution is to implement a custom sorting algorithm that compares the strings based on the specified order. Here's how the solution works:

  1. Read the input values for n and m.

  2. Read the n book titles and store them in a list.

  3. Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings based on the specified order. The function should compare the odd-indexed characters in ascending order and the even-indexed characters in descending order.

  4. Sort the list of book titles using the custom comparison function.

  5. Output the indices of the sorted book titles.

why: |
  This solution correctly solves the problem by implementing a custom sorting algorithm that compares the strings based on the specified order. The custom comparison function ensures that the odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order and the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order. By sorting the list of book titles using this custom comparison function, we can obtain the desired sorting order.

flow:
- Read the input values for n and m.
- Read the n book titles and store them in a list.
- Define a custom comparison function that compares two strings based on the specified order.
- Sort the list of book titles using the custom comparison function.
- Output the indices of the sorted book titles.

Guidelines:
- You must divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Variables names should also be meaningful.
- Double-check the solution code. The generated solution must generalize to any valid input, and not just the provided examples.
- Make sure to include all the necessary module imports, properly initialize the variables, and address the problem constraints.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.



The code output must follow this structure:

- You must divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Variables names should also be meaningful.
- Double-check the solution code. The generated solution must generalize to any valid input, and not just the provided examples.
- Make sure to include all the necessary module imports, properly initialize the variables, and address the problem constraints.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.



The code output must follow this structure:
```
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

You are given a code contest problem, and a self-reflection on the problem.


problem description:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.
======


self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

A Python code solution was generated for the problem:
======

    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    books = []
    for _ in range(n):
        book = input()
        books.append(book)
    return n, m, books

def custom_comparison(a, b):
    for i in range(len(a)):

            if a[i] < b[i]:
                return -1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:

However, when running the following input example, the code solution above failed to produce the expected output:
======

Here is an explanation of how the input should have led to the expected output:

Next, we compare the second character of each title in descending order. Among the remaining titles, "AB" is the smallest because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'B\' comes before \'A\' in the second position.\n\n4. Continuing this process, we find that the next smallest title is "AA" because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the second position.\n\n5. The next smallest title is "BB" because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'B\' comes before \'A\' in the second position.\n\n6. Finally, the last title is "BA" because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the output is "5 2 1 3 4".'}

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b;

We analyzed the error message, and concluded the following about the problem:

The code solution failed to produce the expected output because the `cmp` keyword argument is no longer supported in Python 3. The `cmp` argument was used in the `sort()` method to specify a custom comparison function. However, in Python 3, the `sort()` method only accepts the `key` argument, which is used to specify a function that will be applied to each element for sorting purposes.

1. Read the input values: `n`, `m`, and `books`.
2. Define a custom comparison function `custom_comparison(a, b)` that compares the odd-indexed characters in ascending order and the even-indexed characters in descending order.

5. Return the sorted `indices` list as the output.
=============


Using the analysis above, you need to generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, under the problem constraints.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, not just the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality


The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

  The code solution failed to produce the expected output due to a TypeError. The error occurred because the `sort()` function does not accept the `cmp` keyword argument in Python 3.

  1. Read the input values of `n`, `m`, and the list of book titles.
  2. Create a list of indices from 1 to `n` to keep track of the original positions of the book titles.
  3. Sort the indices based on the lexicographic ascending order of the book titles using the `sort()` method with a lambda function as the key.
  4. Sort the indices again using a custom comparison function that compares the odd-indexed characters in ascending order and the even-indexed characters in descending order.
  5. Print the sorted indices as the final output.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

    for _ in range(n):
        book = input()

=============


However, when running the input-output example test, the code failed to produce the expected output:
=====================================
Error message when running the 'solution code':
'
File "<string>", line 31, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 26, in sort_books
TypeError: 'cmp' is an invalid keyword argument for sort()
'
=====================================


We analyzed the error message, and concluded the following about the problem:
=============
The code solution failed to produce the expected output due to a TypeError. The error occurred because the `sort()` function does not accept the `cmp` keyword argument in Python 3. The code solution is using the `cmp` argument to specify a custom comparison function, which is not supported in Python 3.
=============


Here is a fixed flow, that a correct solution code should follow:
=============
To fix the code solution, we need to remove the `cmp` argument from the `sort()` function and find an alternative approach to achieve the desired sorting order. Here's a fixed flow that will calculate the correct output:

1. Read the input values of `n`, `m`, and the list of book titles.
2. Create a list of indices from 1 to `n` to keep track of the original positions of the book titles.
3. Sort the indices based on the lexicographic ascending order of the book titles using the `sort()` method with a lambda function as the key.
4. Sort the indices again using a custom comparison function that compares the odd-indexed characters in ascending order and the even-indexed characters in descending order.
5. Print the sorted indices as the final output.
=============


Using the analysis above, you need to generate a fixed solution code, that will pass all the tests.
Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- The fixed solution code must pass all the tests, and have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, under the problem constraints.
- Make sure the new solution code generalizes to all possible input-output examples, not just the provided input-output examples.
- You must divide the new solution code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality


The code output must follow this structure:
````
def f1(...):
    ...
    return ...

def f2(...):
    ...
    return ...
...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
The code should read the input using the 'input()' method. Make sure to properly parse the input, according to the problem description.
The output should be printed without additional words using the 'print()' method.

problem description:
======
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

self-reflection on the problem:
======
- The problem is about sorting a list of book titles in a specific order.
- Each book title is represented by a string of uppercase Latin letters.
- The sorting order is a combination of ascending and descending lexicographic order.
- The odd-indexed characters are compared in ascending order, while the even-indexed characters are compared in descending order.
- The output should be the indices of the strings after they are sorted in the specified order.

Initially, the titles are in the following order: "AA", "AB", "BB", "BA", "AZ".\n\n2. Comparing the first character of each title in ascending order, we find that "AZ" is the smallest title because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position.\n\n3. Next, we compare the second character of each title in descending order. Among the remaining titles, "AB" is the smallest because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'B\' comes before \'A\' in the second position.\n\n4. Continuing this process, we find that the next smallest title is "AA" because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the second position.\n\n5. The next smallest title is "BB" because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'B\' comes before \'A\' in the second position.\n\n6. Finally, the last title is "BA" because \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the first position, and \'A\' comes before \'B\' in the second position.\n\nTherefore, the output is "5 2 1 3 4".'}

Your goal is to analyze the code solution and the error, and propose a fix so the code will produce the expected output for the provided test input.
The fix should keep the solution robust, and work for all other input examples as well.
Make sure the fix has a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.


The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedSolution, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
======
class FixedSolution(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Explanation shortly, in words, what was the problem with the code solution, and how should it be fix. Be as specific as possible. Don't generate actuall code.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe, in bullet points, a fixed flow that will calculate the correct output. be specific and elaborate. Emphasize the fixed parts, and how they apply to getting the correct output")

  To fix the code, we can modify the `custom_comparison` function to return -1, 0, or 1 directly, instead of using the `cmp` argument. Here is the fixed code:

  ```python
  def custom_comparison(a, b):
      for i in range(len(a)):
          if i % 2 == 0:
              if a[i] < b[i]:

          else:
              if a[i] > b[i]:

      indices.sort(key=lambda x: books[x-1])
      indices.sort(key=lambda x: books[x-1], cmp=custom_comparison)

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.
=============


A code solution was generated for the problem:
=============
def read_input():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    books = []
    for _ in range(n):
        book = input()
        books.append(book)
    return n, m, books

def custom_comparison(a, b):
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                return -1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                return 1
        else:
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                return -1
            elif a[i] < b[i]:
                return 1
    return 0

def sort_books(n, m, books):
    indices = list(range(1, n+1))
    indices.sort(key=lambda x: books[x-1])
    indices.sort(key=lambda x: books[x-1], cmp=custom_comparison)
    return indices

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n, m, books = read_input()
    indices = sort_books(n, m, books)
    print(*indices)
=============


However, when running the input-output example test, the code solution failed to produce the expected output, and gave the following error message:
=============
File "<string>", line 31, in <module>
  File "<string>", line 26, in sort_books

=============


Using all the information above, your goal is generate a fixed code solution, that will pass the test.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedCode, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class FixedCode(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Describe shortly, in bullet points, what went wrong with the previous solutions.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe a fixed flow leading to the correct solution, in pseudo-code. Be specific and detailed.")
    fixed_code: str = Field(description="A fixed code solution. Don't explain your answer. Just provide the code itself, and nothing else")
=====

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Using all the information above, your goal is generate a fixed code solution, that will pass the test.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedCode, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class FixedCode(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Describe shortly, in bullet points, what went wrong with the previous solutions.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe a fixed flow leading to the correct solution, in pseudo-code. Be specific and detailed.")
    fixed_code: str = Field(description="A fixed code solution. Don't explain your answer. Just provide the code itself, and nothing else")
=====

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.

Using all the information above, your goal is generate a fixed code solution, that will pass the test.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedCode, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class FixedCode(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Describe shortly, in bullet points, what went wrong with the previous solutions.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe a fixed flow leading to the correct solution, in pseudo-code. Be specific and detailed.")
    fixed_code: str = Field(description="A fixed code solution. Don't explain your answer. Just provide the code itself, and nothing else")
=====

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

You are given a code contest problem:
=============
Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of n books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string s_i numbered from 1 to n, each with length m. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.

Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.

A string a occurs before a string b in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where a and b differ, the following holds:

  * if it is an odd position, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b; 
  * if it is an even position, the string a has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. 

Input

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ⋅ m ≤ 10^6).

The i-th of the next n lines contains a string s_i consisting of m uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.

Output

Output n integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.
=============


A code solution was generated for the problem:

Using all the information above, your goal is generate a fixed code solution, that will pass the test.

The output must be a YAML object equivalent to type $FixedCode, according to the following Pydantic definitions:
=====
class FixedCode(BaseModel):
    failed_tests: str = Field(description="List the input-output tests that failed. use the format [{input: .., expected_output: .., code_output: ..}, ...]")
    what_went_wrong: str = Field(description="Describe shortly, in bullet points, what went wrong with the previous solutions.")
    fixed_flow: str = Field(description="Describe a fixed flow leading to the correct solution, in pseudo-code. Be specific and detailed.")
    fixed_code: str = Field(description="A fixed code solution. Don't explain your answer. Just provide the code itself, and nothing else")
=====

Example YAML output:
```yaml
failed_tests: |
  ...
what_went_wrong: |
  ...
fixed_flow: |
  ...
fixed_code: |
  ...
```

Additional guidelines for generating the fixed code:
- Divide the generated code into small sub-functions, with meaningful names and functionality. Keep the code simple and short.
- The fixed code should be robust and general, and work for other input examples as well
- Double-check the new solution code, and make sure it is correct and complete.
- The fixed code must have a reasonable runtime - less than three seconds on a modern computer, given the problem constraints for large input.
- The code needs to be self-contained, and executable as-is.

  - The code is not correctly implementing the custom_comparison function. It is not comparing the odd-indexed characters ascendingly and the even-indexed characters descendingly.
